## Getting Involved

Want to report a bug, request a feature, contribute to or translate Popcorn Time? Check out our in-depth guide to [Contributing to Popcorn Time](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-popcorn-time). We need all the help we can get! You can also join our [community](README.md#community) to keep up-to-date and meet other developers.

## Getting Started

If you're comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.

If you clone the GitHub repository, you will need to build a number of assets using grunt.

The [master](https://github.com/datnguyencse/popcorn-desktop-vn) branch which contains the latest release.

#### Quickstart:

1. `yarn gulp run`

If you encounter trouble with the above method, you can try:

1. `yarn config set yarn-offline-mirror ./node_modules/`
2. `yarn install --ignore-engines`
3. `yarn build`
5. `yarn gulp run`

Optionally, you may simply run `./make_popcorn.sh` if you are on a linux or mac based operating system.

Full instructions & troubleshooting tips can be found in the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-popcorn-time).

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Popcorn Time will be maintained according to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>`

Constructed with the following guidelines:

* A new *major* release indicates a large change where backward compatibility is broken.
* A new *minor* release indicates a normal change that maintains backward compatibility.
* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.
